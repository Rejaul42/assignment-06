        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Discuss the scope of `var`, `let`, and `const`</h1>
        <p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl my-2 text-fuchsia-800 font-medium">'var':</h3> 'var' are hoisted to the top of their
        containing function or global context.This means that you
        can access a var variable before it's declared in the code.</p>
        <p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl my-2 text-fuchsia-800 font-medium">'let':</h3> 'let' variable are not hoisted. You cannot
        access them before they are declared. it's block
        scope, you cane change this variable value.</p>
        <p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl my-2 text-fuchsia-800 font-medium">'const':</h3> 'const' also have block scope, just like
        let. but you can't change this variable value.</p>

    <div class="bg-slate-200 p-4 rounded-2xl mb-8">
        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Tell us the use cases of `null` and `undefined`</h1>

        <p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl my-2 text-fuchsia-800 font-medium">null:</h3>null is typically used when you want to
        explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has
        no
        value or that it is intentionally empty or non-existent. It can be used to represent the intentional absence of
        an
        object or value.</p>
        <p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl my-2 text-fuchsia-800 font-medium">undefined:</h3> Variables that have been declared but
        have not been assigned a value automatically have the
        value undefined.Functions that do not return a value explicitly return undefined.If you try to access an object
        property that does not exist, it will return undefined.</p>

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl my-2 text-fuchsia-800 font-medium">Ans:</h3> REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a
        set
        of architectural principles and constraints used for designing networked applications. It's a style of designing
        networked applications where resources are identified by unique URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and
        interactions
        with these resources are performed using standard HTTP methods. REST is not a protocol; it's an architectural
        style
        that uses HTTP for communication.</p>
